## 2026-10-08 — Quote churn, IB scope, shadow fills

Measured on today's journals (KXINX/KXINXU-26OCT08H1600). Before: KXINX
~20–40 orders/s and KXINXU ~11–20/s, against a 5/s-per-series budget.
After: both ~5–7/s in a live shadow run (4 min each, side by side).

Causes and fixes:

- **Fair value moves ~0.3¢ per signal at ~11 signals/s,** and every move
  that crossed a tick replaced the quote. New
  `QuotingConfig.min_quote_life_s = 2.0`: a quote younger than that is only
  replaced if fair value crosses it outright. The journal replay with this
  setting gave 41 → 7 orders/s (KXINX) and 20 → 7/s (KXINXU).
- **Option spread blowouts went straight into pricing** (98/min, p50
  125ms), swinging B7737's band to [0.12, 0.53]. `LiveOptionBook` now holds
  through them the same way the backtest's `hold_through_wide_spread`
  does: 3-min trailing median, 3×, 300ms settle.
- **The 5th/6th ATM buckets swapped places constantly** (27 flips/min on
  KXINXU). New `QuotingConfig.atm_hysteresis = 2`: a member stays until it
  ranks below `max_markets + 2`.
- **KXINXU was subscribed to 15 buckets but traded only 5.** The IB scope
  is now a contiguous window: the tradeable set plus a margin
  (`SCOPE_MARGIN_BUCKETS`). `run_live` pins `max_markets` to the tradeable
  count, and `rescope_loop` moves the window without reconnecting when ATM
  drifts. Lines: KXINX 48, KXINXU 30, 78 of 100 combined.
- **Shadow takes never used up Kalshi depth.** A 0.01-contract ask got
  "filled" 779 times in 4 minutes. `LiveEngine` now nets its own shadow
  takes against the depth at the touch until that depth changes.
- **`n_unaccounted` counted every shadow cancel** (tens of thousands per
  session). Shadow cancels are now their own outcome, so the invariant
  reads 0 again.
- **A `config_override.json` from September was silently applied** at
  every start. It's now ignored unless it's saved after the session starts.

## 2026-10-08 — `--series` accepts several series

- `kalshi_main/run_live.py --series KXINX KXINXU` (or `KXINX,KXINXU`)
  runs each series as its own child process, with output prefixed
  `[SERIES]`. The direct `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/run_live.py` takes the
  same form for the SPX series.
- `--max-orders-per-s` is now a total across all series: Kalshi's limit
  is per account, so it's split evenly (default 10/s → 5/s each for two).
- `--event-ticker` still needs exactly one series.
- Ctrl-C reaches every child. Each one pulls its quotes and exits; the
  parent waits up to 60s, then force-terminates whatever is left (and
  says to check Kalshi by hand).
- Ctrl-Break used to kill the process without running the quote-pull
  teardown on Windows. It now takes the same path as Ctrl-C.

## 2026-10-08 — IB feed wired into run_live; first live validation

- All IB connections are `readonly=True` (`keys.IB_READONLY`). IB is
  data-only; orders still go to Kalshi.
- `keys.IB_PORT` now 4001 (Gateway live), the port this account uses.
- `run_live` scopes the IB subscription to the ATM buckets
  (`ib_functions.DEFAULT_ATM_BUCKETS`: KXINX 5, KXINXU 15) and uses a
  separate clientId per series so both can run at once.
- `LiveIBFeed` refuses to start if the scope is over the 100-line budget.
- Error 10090 (no SPX index subscription) is filtered from the logs; the
  OPRA leg is unaffected.
- New tools: `kalshi_infra/measure_ib_latency.py`,
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/check_fair_value.py`.

## 2026-10-05 — Live options feed: Databento ES → IB SPXW

**Summary.** Live-trading option feed switched from the retired
Databento ES-daily futures-options stream to native SPXW options on
Interactive Brokers TWS/Gateway. Historical option quotes (backtest
only) still come from Databento. ThetaData and the provider-selector
layer are removed entirely.

Details: [ib-migration.md](ib-migration.md).

### Files added

- `kalshi_infra/ib_functions.py` — IB contract helpers, strike
  resolution, deferred ib_async import.
- `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_ib_feed.py` — live SPXW feed
  implementing the `LiveIBFeed` interface `run_live.py` already
  expected.
- `docs/` — this directory (project-level docs).

### Files removed

- `kalshi_infra/thetadata_functions.py`
- `kalshi_infra/option_source.py`
- `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/__pycache__/live_databento_feed.cpython-312.pyc`
  (stale bytecode of the retired ES-daily feed).

### Files modified

- `kalshi_infra/keys.py` — added `IB_HOST`, `IB_PORT`, `IB_CLIENT_ID`,
  `IB_ACCOUNT` placeholders. IB uses no bearer token.
- `kalshi_latency_arbs/latency_arbs_functions.py` and
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/spxw_signal.py` — now import
  `databento_functions` directly (no `option_source` indirection).
- `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/run_live.py` — comments refreshed (no more
  ES/Databento-feed references); logic unchanged, already called
  `LiveIBFeed`.
- `viz/backtest_cache.py` — dropped `thetadata_functions.py` and
  `option_source.py` from the code-fingerprint globs; dropped
  `data/thetadata/` from the data-fingerprint globs.
- `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_context.py`,
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_persist.py`,
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_orders.py`,
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_kalshi_ws.py`,
  `kalshi_latency_arbs/live/live_signal.py` — stale ES/Databento
  comment references fixed.

### Comment policy

Per CLAUDE.md: docstrings and inline comments are being trimmed to
"fact + reason", with narrative moved to `docs/`. This pass trimmed
the files touched by the migration; others will be trimmed as they are
edited.
